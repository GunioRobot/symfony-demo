Overview
--------

This application is a simple shopping cart manager built with Symfony. It's a
port of the original "Easy-Ajax" demo of symfony 1.x.

Installation
------------

To install it, just checkout the code in your web root, and run the check.php file.

If there are some errors, you need to fix them before to go further. When all
the issues are fixed (mostly write permission on cache/ and logs/ directories),
run the index.php or index_dev.php file.

Enjoy!
